  <p><img alt="Introduction In the following, Ill assume that you convinced yourself in electricity IV that flow and obstacle are inversely related in the circuits that we looked at constant flow obstacle (We got this from fitting a curve to data in table 1 of electricity IV. In that case, the â€˜constant above was actually a curve-fit constant.) Assuming that flow and obstacle are inversely related, here is the model so far. 1. Electricity flows in electric circuits If two bulbs are identical and the same flow of electricity passes through them then they will light with the same brightness (and vice versa). The brightness of a bulb increases if flow through it increases (and vice versa) a. b. No flow is used up by components as it goes around the circuit c. The flow through components that are wired in series is the same d. Theflow going into and coming out of a branch (made of components that are in parallel) is the same 2. There are obstacles to the flow of electricity. Two obstacles in series give an obstacle that is the sum of the two obstacles Two obstacles in parallel give a smaller obstacle than the smaller of the two obstacles alone Other factors being equal, the size of the flow increases ifa component offers it a smaller obstacle (and vice versa). Infact, the flow through a component is inversely proportional to a. b. c. the obstacle that it presents " src="http://d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2F41a%2F41ac3527-39f9-4a4b-9634-2588266e59ca%2Fphp6SOblw.png" style="height:650px;width:990px;" /><img alt="" src="http://d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2F1fe%2F1fe69c0f-2a7c-4d26-ae7b-e792a1b8fcb2%2FphpBrUjaR.png" style="height:837px;width:987px;" /></p> 
  <p>1) Say what happens to the obstacle between points P and Q when the switch closes (Explain, giving the label of the concept that you use)&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>2) Which is bigger: the obstacle presented to the battery when the switch is open or the obstacle presented to the battery when the switch is closed? Explain, giving the labels of the concepts that you use.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p><br /> 3)&nbsp;What will the closing of the switch do to the flow of electricity sent by the battery? Explain, giving the label of the concept that you use.</p> 
  <p>4)&nbsp;make a prediction about the brightness of bulb B when the switch is closed, as compared with its brightness when the switch is open. Explain, giving the label of the concept that you use.</p> 
  <p>5)&nbsp;The brightness of bulb B can also be compared with the brightness of bulb C. Compare the brightness of bulb B with the brightness of bulb C when the switch is closed. Explain, giving the label of any concepts that you use.</p>

        <h2>Answer: </h2><button class="accordion active"><b>Solution</b></button><div class="panel colapse expand"> <p>1.</p>
<p>The obstacle between P and Q decreases(they become parallel
after closing the switch) according to Label 2b.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>&nbsp; It is greater when switch is open according to lables 2a
and 2b. When it is open the overall obstacle is sum of the obstacle
from P and Q(and is greater than A and B). However, when the switch
is closed the obstacle between P and Q decreases and hence the
overall obstacle decreases as compared to the open switch case.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Closing the switch decrease the overall obstacle to the
battery(explained in 2.) So, flow of electricity increases
according to the Label 2c.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The brightness depends on the flow of electricity. As
explained earlier, after closing the switch overall obstacle
decreases and hence the brightness increases(Label 1a).</p>
